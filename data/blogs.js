- Type of opening (swing / sliding)

A well-designed metal gate enhances both protection and visual charm while increasing property value significantly.`

### The Fabrication Process
- **Consultation:** Understanding the architectural theme.
- **Drafting:** CAD designs and 3D rendering.
- **Forging:** Heating and shaping the metal by hand.
- **Finishing:** Applying gold leaf, matte black, or patina finishes.

The result is not just a building component, but a piece of permanent art.`
